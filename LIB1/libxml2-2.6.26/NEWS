    whileinitiallyscheduled for Apr 3 the release occurred only on Apr 12 due
    tomassiveworkload.
   - The include are now located under $prefix/include/libxml

    pointofview applications should not have to be modified too much, check
    theupgrade page
   - Some interfaces may changes (especially a bit about encoding).
   - the updates includes:
    fix I18N support. ISO-Latin-x/UTF-8/UTF-16 (nearly)
        seemscorrectlyhandled now
      Better handling of entities, especially well-formedness
        checkingandproper PEref extensions in external subsets
      DTD conditional sections
      Validation now correctly handle entities content
      changestructuresto
        accommodate DOM

1.8.7: Mar 6 2000:
   - This is a bug fix release:

    this.Notethat for adherence to XML spec, this behaviour will be
    disabledbydefault in 2.x . The same function will allow to keep
    compatibilityforold code.
   - Blanks in <a>  </a> constructs are not
    ignoredanymore,avoiding heuristic is really the Right Way :-\
